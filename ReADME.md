Latticist provides a graphical user interface for exploratory
  visualisation. It is primarily an interface to the Lattice graphics
  system, but also produces displays from the vcd package for categorical
  data. Given a multivariate dataset (either a data frame or a table),
  latticist attempts to produce useful displays based on the properties
  of the data. The displays can be customised by editing the calls used to
generate them.
